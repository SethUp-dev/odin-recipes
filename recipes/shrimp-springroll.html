    <li>Near the bottom of the spring roll in the center, lay out the cucumber, carrots, green leaf lettuce, fresh mint leaves, and cooked shrimp. Line the shrimp in a row.</li>
    <li>Fold the bottom over the end of the veggies and shrimp, then fold the uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper all the way, as tightly wrapped as possible. Then repeat with the remaining ingredients.
